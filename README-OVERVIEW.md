## Overview

Cryptobloc is a secure automated crypto-based trading platform with a plugin architecture that makes it easy to add new exchanges, wallets, financial indicators, and trading strategies. Cryptobloc has a portfolio that lists all of your wallet and exchange accounts in one place with an option to have an automated trading bot perform trades on your behalf. Transaction histories are available with point-in-time fees and pricing with bookkeeping features that make it easy to export IRS form 8949 statements based on a configurable accounting strategy (FIFO, LIFO, specific identification).

Create your own financial indicators and trading strategies used by the trading bot and publish them on the future marketplace that allows developers to monetize their efforts. Even conventional stock market exchanges, fiat "wallets" and lending features can be supported.

## Features

Cryptobloc is a powerful automated trading platform that provides valuable insights necessary to make intelligent and responsible trades using accurate real-time and historical price data that is easily reported during tax season.

Cryptobloc aggregates all of your coins across various exchange and wallet accounts together into one place, making it easy to send / receive funds, execute trades, and track transactions. The built-in bookkeeping and tax reporting features make it simple to export data needed for tax season and provide insightful data to trading algorithms.

Transaction histories are rich with essential data that are both time consuming and challenging to gather manually, such as fees and point-in-time fiat price conversions that show the value of the transaction at the time it happened, using actual price data rather than averages or daily close prices that could be wildly inaccurate due to market volatility. Bookkeeping features allow transactions to be categorized, that when properly accounted for, make the once dreaded crypto tax reporting, a simple one-click process.

## Architecture

Cryptobloc features a plug-in architecture that allows developers to create custom trading indicators and strategies to fit any style of trading you can imagine, from scalp to position trading, using traditional programming or artificial intelligence, Cryptobloc provides the hooks and data you need to execute profitable trades and accurate reports.

Built on Ethereum, Cryptobloc features are driven by community votes and integrity is enforced by smart contracts stored and executed via the Blockchain.

Cryptobloc exposes many of it's features via REST and Websocket using JWT for authentication, providing a standard and straight-forward approach to integrating your own custom applications.
